    "Usually developers, system administrators, devop engineers, etc. interact with the the linux operating system via a textual interface, called the shell. The most common type of shell is called `bash`. For now, the differences between these is not so important, but during troubleshooting it might help to know which shell you are using.\n",

The `%%bash` as well as the exclamation mark (`!`) in the lines is only for the notebook. The `%%bash` transforms the whole cell into a bash terminal while the `!` runs only a single command via the shell."

It simplifies navigation.\n",

    "Typically, when you open up a terminal, your session will start in the `~` folder. This is not always the case, as for the notebook here for example. The notebook and the shell open up in the folder from where they are launched. Let us look at that first."

The `>` operator redirects the output to a file instead of displaying it to the terminal. The `>>` appends to a file instead of overwriting.
